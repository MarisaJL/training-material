Galaxy is a free, community-built web interface that helps scientists analyse data in a way that’s easy to use, transparent and reproducible.

While it is widely used in biology and other fields, many people still do not fully understand its capabilities. Some think it’s only for analysing DNA, or that it’s too slow, too technical, or only useful in classrooms.

In [this article](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013869), we take on **10 common misconceptions** about the Galaxy interface and show how it’s a powerful, flexible tool used by researchers, educators and even clinicians worldwide.
With **real-world examples and current evidence**, we explain how Galaxy supports health data analysis, scales to massive datasets and maintains high software quality—all while staying free and open to everyone.

The 10 common misconceptions addressed are:

1. **“It is only useful for genome scientists”**—Protein scientist
2. **“It offers nothing to coders.”**—Bioinformaticians
3. **“It does not scale to large and complex problems”**—Scientist
4. **“It’s hard to use.”**—Educators
5. **“It is only useful for teaching, not research.”**—Principal Investigator
6. **“It cannot be used on secure data”**—Clinician
7. **“It’s free, so it must be low-quality without any professional staff supporting it.”**—Researchers
8. **“It’s open source, so the documentation and support must be poor.”**—Principal Investigators
9. **“It cannot be sustainable without a commercial organisation managing it.”**—Principal Investigators
10. **“Its tools and supported analyses are outdated”**—Bioinformaticians

We aim to help more people understand Galaxy’s true potential and feel confident using it in their work.
