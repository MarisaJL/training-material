- Slides a great way to introduce an audience to your subject.
- They're best to use for a quick overview, not a detailed look at the subject.
- Lots of images can be a good choice to communicate information, and avoid slides full of text when possible as learners can get bored or distracted.

## What is a Special Interest Group (SIG)?

- Background information for the tutorial. E.g.:
  - Motivation why X is useful
  - Concepts needed to get most out of tutorial

- If your slides are attached to a tutorial, then they can be a good place to provide learners with motivation for the tutorial.
- If you can provide examples that are relevant to your audience, this will encourage them to follow the tutorial.
- Try to avoid dry text and links to external resources whenever possible, those can be best in the tutorial which a learner would read at their own pace, rather than slides which are presented at the presenter's pace.
